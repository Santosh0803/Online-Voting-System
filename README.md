- **Real-time Vote Tracking**: Instant vote counting and result calculation
- **Duplicate Vote Prevention**: Robust checks to prevent multiple votes from the same voter ID
- **Result Analytics**: View detailed voting statistics and leading party information
- **Database Integration**: Persistent storage of voting data using MySQL

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language
- **Java Swing**: GUI framework
- **MySQL**: Database management
- **JDBC**: Database connectivity
- **Maven**: Dependency management

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture:
1. **Presentation Layer**: Java Swing GUI components
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Vote processing and validation
3. **Data Layer**: MySQL database integration

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- MySQL Server
- MySQL Connector/J
- IDE (Eclipse, NetBeans, or IntelliJ IDEA)

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a MySQL database named `votingsys`
3. Update database credentials in the `connect()` method
4. Create the required table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE votes (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
